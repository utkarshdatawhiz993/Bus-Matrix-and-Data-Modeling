# Property Investment Portfolio Project: Bus-Matrix-and-Data-Modeling

Before initiating the data modeling process, I developed a data pipeline using SSIS to ingest and stage data into six staging tables:

Stag_Aus_Suburb, Stag_Aus_Crime, Stag_HouseValue, Stag_RentalValue, Stag_Transport, and Stag_School.

This staging layer ensured clean, structured, and consistent data ready for transformation and modeling.

After sorting the staging tables, My work has been to come out with Bus Matrix to sort the design for my data model
