# Property Investment Portfolio Project: Bus-Matrix-and-Data-Modeling

Before initiating the data modeling process, I developed a data pipeline using SSIS to ingest and stage data into six staging tables:

Stag_Aus_Suburb, Stag_Aus_Crime, Stag_HouseValue, Stag_RentalValue, Stag_Transport, and Stag_School.

This staging layer ensured clean, structured, and consistent data ready for transformation and modeling.

After organizing and preparing the staging tables, I developed a Bus Matrix to define the core business processes and shared dimensions. This step was essential in designing a scalable and consistent data model structure, ensuring alignment across different subject areas before proceeding with the modeling phase.
